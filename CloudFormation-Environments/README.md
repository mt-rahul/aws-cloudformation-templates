# CloudFormation: Environments

This example shows how to create parameterized stacks, so e.g. you can create different environments of your stack.
The same resources are created with different names and belong to a different stack.


## Quick Start

Run:

    export LAMBDA_BUCKET=<your-lambda-bucket> && ./deploy.sh
